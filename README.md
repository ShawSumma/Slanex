# Slanex
The Slanex programming language

slanex is a lisp. That means alot of the parenthesis.
Unlike the last lisp i had created, it runs on it's own Virtual Machiene.
It's approximatly 30 times slower than CPython. 

It is not ready for anything but testing.

there are two builtin libraries:
time and version
more to come

to build you must have boost installed, a C++17 compiler, and -lgmp for linking
